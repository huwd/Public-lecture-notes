# Public-lecture-notes
Notes from Public Lectures I have attended, written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

All notes are written on the fly and later edited for grammar and spelling.
Quotations are an attempt to capture the presenters own words but should be treated with the caution as everything was rapidly typed with limited means to fact check.

Thoughts of the author are listed separately between square brackets.

If you also attended the lecture and have corrections / amendments they can be submitted as a pull request.

Efforts will be made to link to audio/video material where possible.
