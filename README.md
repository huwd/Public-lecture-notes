# Public-lecture-notes

## Overview
Notes from Public Lectures I have attended, written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

All notes are written on the fly and later edited for grammar and spelling.
Quotations are an attempt to capture the presenters own words but should be treated with the caution as everything was rapidly typed with limited means to fact check.

Notes are to be accurate in terms of reflecting what the speaker actually said, corrections for what they actually meant or if the information given was inaccurate/false should happen elsewhere.

Thoughts of the note taker listed separately between square brackets where clarification or context might be useful.

If you also attended the lecture and have corrections / amendments they can be submitted as a pull request.
