# Public-lecture-notes

## Overview
Notes from Public Lectures I have attended, written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

All notes are written on the fly and later edited for grammar and spelling.
Quotations are an attempt to capture the presenters own words but should be treated with the caution as everything was rapidly typed with limited means to fact check.

Notes reflect what a speaker actually said - where speakers mispoke and reasonable guesses can be made towards their meaning, corrections will be made inline. Otherwise houghts of the note taker are listed separately between square brackets where clarification or context might be useful.

If you also attended the lecture and have corrections / amendments and want to submit a pull request, I'm happy to take edits.
